Welcome to the vms wiki!
I started to contribute to VMS through the Google Code-in program. I had absolutely no experience with Python, HTML, or CSS, so doing this was a huge leap for me. The installation of the system was a smooth process overall. The guide that comes with VMS is really helpful, although some changes could be made, like being more specific about certain commands. Because I've never really used Postgresql or Vagrant, I was kind of confused when I installed some things, and at times I wasn't sure if I was doing things right, but if you stick to the Installation Guide, you should be alright. However, if there really is a problem that you just cannot resolve, it is best to Google the issue or go on Stack Overflow, like I did. In the wort scenario, you can contact the contributors to VMS through Slack, and they are really helpful! Hope this helps :)
